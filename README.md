## Overview

GoProm periodically load promotions into Redis and expose the data via an HTTP API. It's composed by two applications
that run separately: **api** and **loader**.  
The `api` simple expose an endpoint to query promotions its identifier.  
The `loader` reads a **csv** file in a specific path, by default **data**, and sends all data to Redis. It's triggered
by a `cron`.
The `loader`workflow is the following:

- a `crontab` executes the `loader` every 1 minute.
- the `loader` checks if there's any new promotions.csv file in a specified directory.
- no promotions file, it will exit.
- found a promotions file, now it'll read the promotions and generate a file with Redis commands for every entry.
- after generating the commands file with every promotion and their respective expiration, it will send the commands to
  Redis CLI and the CLI will finally send all data to the server.
